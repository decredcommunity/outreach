# Decred Tweeting Style Guide

* Always tag @decredproject when tweeting. It's not enough to use #Decred or $DCR. If you want it to be seen and RT'd by the project account we need to be notified about the tweet.

* If at an event, use the proper hashtag e.g., #Consensus2018 this massively increases the visibility as many people will follow trending hashtags. Other tags like #blockchain, #crypto, or #fintech can help a great deal as well.

* Don't make spelling mistakes. Proof your tweets, even the silly ones, we like to look professional even when we're screwing around. We usually won't RT things that contain spelling or grammatical errors.

* Tag the people in your tweet, and tag them in pictures (always include pics when possible). It increases the chance of receiving a RT from them and getting us outside the echo chamber of people who follow Decred already.

* Cash tags are useful but use them sparingly. $DCR $BTC $BCH $XMR $TOKEY gets your tweet in front of more eyeballs but the tags need to be relevant to the tweet so as to not come off as spammy.

* Tweet incessantly. There's no reason each person at an event shouldn't be able to bang out 2-3 tweets per day. If we have 10 people attending an event, that gives us a nice pool of 20-30 tweets to potentially RT and will convey the fact that we're players in the space, as people see the content streaming along their timeline or sprinkled through the hashtags they monitor.

Example: "Chilling at #Consensus2018 with @JoeRando talking @decredproject and how $DCR prevents issues like we've seen with $BTC $BCH $BTG $BCD $BTCP and all the other recent #blockchain forks."
