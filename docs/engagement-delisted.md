# Decred Community Engagement Guide

## What to Do If DCR Is Delisted/Geofenced

Decred's community is decentralized, which means every member is entitled to their opinions on social media. This document is intended to suggest best practices for social media engagement that position Decred in the best possible light and serve the best interests of the project.

### The Situation

As crypto regulation evolves, uncertainty is inevitable. Delistings/geofencing are byproducts of an unclear regulatory environment, as exchanges and other newsmaking entities make decisions to protect themselves and meet perceived regulatory requirements. Sometimes, those decisions will impact Decred and other cryptocurrencies. And while exchanges may attribute their decisions to regulatory factors, other reasons may be at play that are not made public.

### Our Recommendation

Less communication is better than more on regulatory topics, as anything you say may be used against Decred, so we advise silence. Publicly shared opinions on controversial topics can make any crypto project an easy target for regulators and/or opponents. We don't want the narrative to slip out of Decred's control.

Although we advise against public communication on this topic, if any community member feels compelled to speak out on social media, keep it positive/neutral. Suggested language includes:

* I'm not a lawyer, and that exchange hasn't reached out to us for more information about Decred.
* In this uncertain regulatory environment, these types of decisions are inevitable. I hope we'll get more clarity in the coming months so that exchanges are able to make better-informed decisions.

### What Not to Say

* Avoid making any statements about whether or not Decred could be perceived as a security.
* Avoid negative opinions about other cryptocurrencies that have been delisted/geofenced along with Decred. We recommend against using derogatory words like "shitcoins".
* Avoid negative opinions about exchanges and regulators.
