## Image limits

- Instagram posts can be square, landscape, or vertical. All images will be cropped to a square in the feed.
- The ideal size for square posts is 1080px by 1080px at a 1:1 aspect ratio.
- For landscape posts, use an image that is 1080px by 566px, with an aspect ratio of 1.91:1.
- Vertical images should be sized at 1080px by 1350px with a 4:5 aspect ratio.


## Text limits

- Captions: 2,200 chars (about 330 words)
  - 125 chars is recommended but not at the cost of important info [length, upleap]
- Captions: 30 hashtags
  - some recommend 5 [algo], some >11 [upleap]
- Bio: 150 chars
- DM: 1,000 chars
- Links are not clickable
- Links are not even _selectable_ on mobile apps (should work via browser)
  - common workaround is to use short links that are easy to type e.g. `site.com/hello`, or put 1 link in bio and keep it up to date
- Bio can host 1 clickable link

> While Instagram doesn't seem to specify a maximum total number of caption characters, it does note that, within users' feeds, the [caption is cut off after the first three lines](https://help.instagram.com/1643471055915254). For that reason, it's advised to limit captions to 125 characters. However, don't leave out important information just for the sake of keeping your entire caption visible. Instead, frontload it with crucial details and calls-to-action, leaving any hashtags, @mentions, or extraneous information for the end.


## Notes

- We are guests on Instagram. We own almost nothing. All hard work put into growing an account can be lost, it's up to the host. Therefore, invest wisely and don't grow dependency on Instagram. Direct to other places.
