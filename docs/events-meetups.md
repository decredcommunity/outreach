## Strategies for Locations	
* How to get them donated( X the # of people = the $ for the place)
* Locations that are willing to accept Decred are preferred:
    * If they don't accept DCR ask them if they are willing to and show them how to set it up via coinpayments, cointopay. Globee, wirex, etc...
    * If they accept DCR we also do press releases and inform our whole community online, etc...
* Have arrangements for unusual requests
    * Ex: If they request $ in sales, make sure we will be able to meet that expectation or that it's a place worth guaranteeing their request.
* Where to choose: 
    * Choose areas that are trendy and centrally located
    * Make sure they are well ventilated, heated, and have adequate bathrooms etc..
    * Choose places that we can build a relationship with
    * Place that has audio/visual is a plus so we don't have to bring in
    * Place where security is not an issue for our participants.
