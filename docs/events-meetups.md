# Facilitating a meetup guidelines


## Strategies for locations	

* How to get them donated (X the # of people = the $ for the place)
* Locations that are willing to accept DCR are preferred:
  * If they don't accept DCR ask them if they are willing to and show them how to set it up via CoinPayments, Cointopay, Globee, Wirex, etc.
  * If they accept DCR we also do press releases and inform our whole community online, etc.
* Have arrangements for unusual requests
  * Ex: If they request $ in sales, make sure we will be able to meet that expectation or that it's a place worth guaranteeing their request.
* Where to choose:
  * Choose areas that are trendy and centrally located
  * Make sure they are well ventilated, heated, and have adequate bathrooms etc.
  * Choose places that we can build a relationship with
  * Place that has audio/visual is a plus so we don't have to bring in
  * Place where security is not an issue for our participants
  * How to set up at (incubators, restaurants etc.) - ask Clarissa


## Strategies for who to invite

* Outreach websites (meetup.com, eventbrite.com etc.)
* Ask about interest at other meetups and local events
* Messaging (use keywords to get involvement, ie. blockchain, crypto)
