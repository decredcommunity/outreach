# Medium

1\. Avoid complex Markdown that does not paste cleanly into Medium editor:

- Paragraph breaks and blockquotes inside list items. Keep list items simple.
- Nested lists.
- In general, avoid combining _any_ two structural features to be extra safe.
- Two adjacent blockquotes are merged in one if they are not separated by normal text. Try adding more blank lines to break them.

If you really want to use advanced Markdown features (e.g. on GitHub), prepare a separate, simplified Markdown file for Medium that work-arounds all Medium's formatting issues.

2\. Table of Contents must be recreated manually.

3\. Local links like `[other doc](other-doc.md)` must be fixed manually.

4\. Add relevant tags.

Some relevant Medium tags:

- https://medium.com/tag/decred
- https://medium.com/tag/cryptocurrency
- https://medium.com/tag/decentralized-exchange
- https://medium.com/tag/cryptocurrency-news
- https://medium.com/tag/crypto

5\. Fill the summary text.

It is 140 characters max and is shown under post title on listing pages like https://medium.com/decred or https://medium.com/decred/journals/home .
