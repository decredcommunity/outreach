## At the event
### Stand Set Up
### Manning the stand

***Handling loiterers and speaking to everyone at the stand***

When manning the stand, some poeple will loiter for a while reducing your ability to engange with others who are also interested. To avoid this, keep conversations at a high level when there are a lot of people waiting at the stand and offer to pick up with more detailed conversations after the event or during a break. If a conversation is going on for too long, you can try doing the following:

1) If someone else is loitering behind waiting to ask questions, say hello to them and bring them into the conversation

2) Say “I’m really enjoying this conversation and I’d love to pick it up in more depth over a coffee later. Could you drop me a line?” and hand over your card

3) Be polite and up front - “this has been a really interesting conversation. I’m going to work the room and see what other projects are up to. Maybe Ill bump into you again soon”
