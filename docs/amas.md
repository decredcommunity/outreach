# Running AMA and Q&A sessions

This guide was written primarily for Reddit "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) events. AMAs on YouTube and other platforms could differ and may need their separate guides or sections.


## For AMA organizers

- Check past AMAs on r/decred or r/cryptotechnology for inspiration

- Talk to outreach/marketing peers

  - _Estimate_ good dates for collecting questions and answers
  - Consider not only a Reddit AMA but also YouTube video (live stream or edited). It is more interactive/engaging and establishes a stronger connection with the audience, at the cost of being harder to organize and taking more resources to execute.

- Talk to people who would answer the questions

  - Agree on the dates
  - Secure their commitment to participate
  - Ask for "recommended read" materials to offer for reading before asking, this might prevent some boring questions and improve other questions

- Ask Reddit moderators if they will be available to help running the AMA

- Draft the AMA announcement

  - State date window when the questions will be accepted (5 days sounds ok)
  - State date window when the questions will be answered, and after what point to not expect any new answers (3 days sounds ok)
  - Name people who have committed to answering the questions
  - State if the questions will be answered in the same place where they were collected or in a new place (same thread seems more productive)
  - Post the draft announcement for experts' review and approval

- Announce the AMA to the public in advance

  - Tweet via main project account with most important details: dates, people, topics, and where to post questions

- Collect questions

- When answering time comes

  - Resubmit ("crosspost") the thread with questions to bump it to the top of the subreddit and announce the answers
  - Either lock the new ann thread to avoid any questions being posted there by mistake
  - OR write in bold to ask questions in the original (linked) thread and only post \*meta\* discussion in the new ann thread
  - OR create special top-level comment in the original thread to collect feedback on how the AMA itself is handled
  - State again the date window when to expect the answers
  - Link subreddit rules
  - Tweet via main project account that the answers have started

- Stay around and curate the process

- Update this document as needed


## For moderators and commenters

Quick rules:

- Top level comment must contain at least one question
- Post a separate comment for each question (or a group of related questions)

These are not allowed and will be removed:

- Top level comments that contain no questions
- Duplicate questions. Use Ctrl-F to search if your question was already asked.
  - Before removing, make sure the question is *identical* ot an existing question, i.e. contains no unique parts.
- Too short and broad questions like "when moon?"
- Questions that are written poorly and take too long to understand. If your English is poor please do your best to translate (ask for help if necessary) and we will do our best to answer.
- All regular subreddit rules apply: no spam, FUD, CAPS or font abuse etc.

If your question was removed, you can reformulate and post it again.


## Announcement template

Open this document in RAW Markdown and copy the text below the line. Replace placeholders in `{ curly braces }` with real data. Then, post [as Gist](https://gist.github.com/) for review by the experts. When it is good, post on Reddit.

title: { topic } (Ask Me Anything)

Hi everyone!

I am organizing an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session about { topic }. { A, B, ... } have agreed to participate, others may join too.

Here are the rules:

- Questions are collected starting from now and until { end date }.

- Answers will start { answers stard date } and keep going as long as the experts wish to continue. Questions that come too late risk to not get answered.

- The answers will be posted in \*this thread\* to keep everything in one place.

- When experts start answering we will post another notice on Reddit and Twitter.

- Top level comments must contain \*at least one question\*.

- Post a separate comment for each question (or a group of related questions), or upvote existing questions.

These are not allowed and may be removed:

- Top level comments that contain no questions.
- Duplicate questions. Use Ctrl-F to search if your question was already asked.
- Too short and broad questions like "when moon?".
- Questions that are written poorly and take too long to understand. If English is not your native language please do your best to translate (or ask for help!) and we will do our best to answer.
- All regular [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/about/rules/) apply: no spam, FUD, CAPS or font abuse etc.

If your question was removed for the above reasons, you can reformulate and post it again.

It is recommended to read these materials to learn about { topic } and ask better questions:

- { links from experts }
