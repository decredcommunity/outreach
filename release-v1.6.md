# Decred v1.6 Release Cheatsheet

v1.6 will be one of the biggest and ground breaking releases Decred ever made.

We need any help we can get to get our message out.

Here Decred advocates can learn about v1.6 features, copy reusable text bits and find links to design assets (images, videos, memes etc).

## Feature Overview

{ focus on user-facing changes first }

### Coin mixing to protect your privacy

{ non-custodial, simple architecture, reliable, but needs to be used with care }

### New voting architecture

_Intro_: Voting service providers (VSP) vote with your tickets on your behalf so that you don't need to run a server 24/7. They cannot spend your coins, only vote. Roughly 50% of voters use VSPs while the other half is "solo voters" who run their own voting wallets.

_Existing_ VSP system has worked for years but it suffers from privacy and UX issues. You have to create an account, share an email address and reuse addresses on the blockchain.

_New_ VSP architecture will resolve all these issues. No accounts, no email, no address reuse.

It doesn't stop there - new approach can be combined with the privacy mixer to enable _private staking_.

### Decentralized Treasury control

_Intro_: Decred [Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx?n=20&start=0&txntype=merged_debit) is holding more than $7M worth of DCR. The funds are allocated to projects approved by the stakeholders via Decred's [Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org/) proposal system.

In v1.6 we will vote whether to enable decentralized control of Treasury funds.

In the proposed system, stakeholders ("ticket holders") will vote whether to approve or reject a transaction that spends funds from the Treasury to pay for work done by contractors over the previous month.
