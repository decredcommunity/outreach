_I've put together a short blurb that I'll be using on anyone who I suspect is going to ask me for money, I no longer have patience for taking pitch calls. I rather focus more on higher value targets. Will post it here for review and in case anyone else wants to use/adapt it for their own purposes._

As a decentralized project, there are two main ways with which Decred handles integrations.

* If there are no fees involved any service provider is free to add Decred support, we're also happy to address questions that your developers may have in our Slack channels (https://slack.decred.org/).

* If there are costs that the project would need to cover, a proposal must be drafted and voted on by the Decred stakeholders. What that would entail is someone from your side putting all the relevant information into our system, which is named Politeia, at https://proposals.decred.org/
A good proposal will address; what, why, how, who, and when (https://github.com/decred/politeia/blob/master/politeia.md#how-to-submit-a-politeia-pi-proposal).
You can see an example of a proposal that passed recently here: https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/27f87171d98b7923a1bd2bee6affed929fa2d2a6e178b5c80a9971a92a5c7f50

Basically, the steps required are:

1. Create an account on Politeia (costs ~$4 of Decred).
   https://proposals.decred.org/
2. Submit a proposal (also costs ~$4 of Decred).
3. Get comments/feedback from Decred stakeholders.
4. Edit the proposal to address feedback if you wish.
5. Authorize the start of a vote.
6. The vote will last 7 days in which any Decred holder that is staking may vote. If 60% vote yes the proposal passes.

If you have any further questions do not hesitate to reach out to us either on Slack on one of the other platforms we are present on (see https://www.decred.org/community/).
